# tic-tac-toe-game
## Summary
This program is designed to have two users play tic tac toe. It takes one argument, from 1-9, and writes their input into the board. 
The board is indexed from 1-9 as the board is 3x3 and 1-3 represent the first row, 4-6 represent the second row, and 7-9 represent the 
last row. If the user gives a wrong input, the program will keep requesting a new position until it is correct. If the position given 
is taken already, it keeps asking for a new position until there is an empty slot given.
Initally, all the positions on the board are unoccupied, filled with '-'.



**This project was created to work more with creating functions, lists, and user input.**
